Javascript Thermostat
=================

This week, we got to grips with Javascript and built the logic needed to model a simple thermostat.

Jasmine was used to Test-Drive Development and jQuery was used to allow users to interact with the thermostat.

We also incorporated the OpenWeatherMap API to pull in temperatures from cities around the world.

Specifications
-----

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with the up button
- You can decrease the temperature with the down button
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
- The thermostat should colour the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red
